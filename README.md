# Eskrima Counters Timer

An modified version of my own [Metronome](https://github.com/wongcain/metronome-android) Android project, updated and repurposed for practicing Eskrima attack-counters. It was inspired by the COVID-19 quarantine and provides a way for us to practice our Eskrima attack-counters wihtout having a partner feeding us attacks.  In addition to the metronome functionality, it uses Android Text-To-Speech to randomly call out a configurable attack-counter numbers.
